### What I learned

During this challenge i learned BEM to make css styling easier and cleaner for maintenance. Also i put on practice a few things that i learned for scss like the & selector.

To start with BEM method i've first watched this video [You Probably Need BEM CSS in Your Life (Tutorial)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=er1JEDuPbZQ&t=834s)


### Continued development

On future projects i want to scale the magnitude of it, i fell capable and secure to work with extensives css and the BEM method simplified a lot of errors i made on other projects that took a lot of time to solve fighting with selectors.
